# Customer-Segmentation
Customer Segmentation is the process of dividing a market into discrete customer groups that share similar purchasing or usage characteristics. K-Means CLustering is one of the techniques that can be used to achieve this.

Companies that identify these segments can outperform competition by creating uniquely appealing products, developing different pricing strategies and marketing campaigns.
